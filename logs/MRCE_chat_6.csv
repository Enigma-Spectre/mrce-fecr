Quantum tunneling refers to the phenomenon where particles can traverse a potential energy barrier or gap without sufficient classical energy, due to the wave-like nature of particles and the probabilistic principles of quantum mechanics."

Quantum tunneling is the phenomenon where particles can traverse seemingly insurmountable energy barriers by exploiting probabilistic fluctuations, allowing them to appear on the other side without possessing sufficient classical energy."
2025-06-06T16:41:56,Coordinator,explain quantum tunnelling in a sentence,"I'm not answering the user's query directly just yet! As the Coordinator, I'll summarize consensus among agents instead.

According to our current context, there is no consensus among agents regarding quantum tunneling. The FECR (FECR Vector) indicates that all agents have a similar level of confidence in their responses, but we don't have any concrete information on this topic yet."
2025-06-06T16:42:05,Psi‑E,explain quantum tunnelling in a sentence,"FECR analysis indicates: Quantum tunneling occurs when particles bypass classical energy barriers by exploiting probabilistic fluctuations, permitting non-physical interactions and facilitating phenomena like radioactive decay or electron transfer."
2025-06-06T16:42:13,Critic,explain quantum tunnelling in a sentence,"Quantum tunneling is when particles can pass through seemingly impenetrable barriers by exploiting the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, allowing them to exist on the ""wrong"" side of the barrier with a non-zero probability.

**Grade:** 

* Logical rigor: 8/10 (reasonable summary, but some oversimplification)
* Originality: 4/10 (not particularly new or creative explanation)
* Alignment with stated FECR vector: 7/10 (close to the guide's tone and style, but not exactly matching the specified emphasis)

**Total score:** 19/30"
